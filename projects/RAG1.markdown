TableRAG: TableRAG is an advanced system designed for handling complex table-based question answering tasks. The system combines cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, optimized specifically for multi-table environments. This project addresses the challenges posed by real-world scenarios, where users may need to query a set of related tables rather than a single one, by integrating advanced filtering, clarification, and retrieval mechanisms.
TextRAG: TextRAG is a high-performance retrieval and generation system specifically designed for processing unstructured text data. By integrating key techniques such as Context Segmentation, Context Generation, and Chunks Integration, TextRAG excels in delivering precise and comprehensive answers to complex queries. In evaluations conducted within the financial domain, TextRAG demonstrated a significant performance improvement, achieving an accuracy rate of 79% under a Shared Vector Store configuration, substantially outperforming the traditional benchmark accuracy of 19%. This highlights TextRAGâ€™s exceptional capability in handling multi-document integration and complex information retrieval tasks.
EasyRAG: EasyRAG is an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to simplify configuration, enhance integration, and optimize lightweight operations. It significantly lowers the learning curve for RAG applications through an intuitive interface and flexible module support, enabling developers to quickly and efficiently deploy and run complex natural language processing tasks while ensuring data security and high-performance processing. Whether for beginners or experienced developers, Easyrag offers a powerful and scalable solution for a wide range of application scenarios.
