## Introduction

In recent years, models based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology have made significant advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). RAG technology combines the strengths of information retrieval and text generation to effectively address the "hallucination" problem commonly seen in traditional generative models, where the generated content may not align with factual information. Additionally, RAG technology does not rely on extensive fine-tuning or pre-training processes, which not only reduces computational resource requirements but also significantly enhances the modelâ€™s flexibility and adaptability. More importantly, RAG technology can directly retrieve the required information from external corpora, without the need to pre-construct and maintain a large knowledge base. This "plug-and-play" feature makes RAG systems perform exceptionally well in many practical applications. However, while the implementation of RAG technology is not complex, building a high-performing and stable RAG system is challenging. To gain a deeper understanding and optimization of RAG technology, this paper systematically summarizes the design and enhancement methods of key components in current RAG systems and proposes several potential optimization strategies to provide references for future research and applications.

## 1. Basic Paradigms of RAG

The design of RAG systems encompasses various paradigms, achieving efficient synergy between information retrieval and text generation by organically combining sparse and dense retrieval methods. Optimizing retriever design and introducing pre-retrieval and post-retrieval augmentation techniques can significantly enhance the performance of the generator.

### 1.1 Sparse Retrieval Methods

- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a traditional text retrieval method based on term frequency and inverted indexing. It locates the most relevant documents by measuring the importance of terms in a document. In RAG systems, TF-IDF is often used for paragraph-level retrieval to enhance the quality of the generator's input. However, since this method relies on surface-level term frequency, it may not fully capture the semantic information of terms, potentially limiting its performance when dealing with complex queries.

- **BM25**: BM25 is another retrieval method based on term frequency and inverted indexing. It represents documents as a bag of words and ranks them based on term frequency and inverse document frequency. BM25 is particularly effective in large-scale text database queries and is one of the most widely used paragraph retrieval methods in RAG models. Compared to TF-IDF, BM25 introduces parameters to adjust the frequency effect of terms, thereby improving retrieval robustness to some extent.

### 1.2 Dense Retrieval Methods

- **DPR (Dense Passage Retriever)**: DPR is a dense retriever based on the BERT architecture, designed and pre-trained specifically for open-domain question-answering tasks. DPR embeds queries and documents into the same vector space and retrieves them based on the semantic similarity of embedding vectors, demonstrating strong pre-training capabilities. This method serves as a critical component in many RAG models, significantly enhancing their performance in handling complex semantic queries.

- **Contriever**: Contriever is a dense retriever based on contrastive learning, using a single encoder architecture pre-trained on large-scale unaligned documents. It has shown excellent performance in open-domain question-answering tasks. Contriever is particularly suited for integration with large models like InstructGPT, performing exceptionally well in diversified tasks.

- **Spider**: Similar to Contriever, Spider is a general-purpose pre-trained dense retriever, pre-trained through contrastive learning to adapt to various tasks and domains. The flexibility and efficiency of Spider make it widely used in many RAG methods, especially when dealing with large-scale corpora.

### 1.3 Retriever Design

- **Bi-Encoder**: The Bi-Encoder consists of two independent BERT-based encoders, one for processing queries and the other for documents. This design is often used for sentence embedding similarity retrieval and diverse example retrieval, enabling the extraction and application of general knowledge through parameter freezing or partial freezing.

- **One-Encoder**: The One-Encoder structure processes queries and documents using a single encoder, typically based on Transformer, BERT, or other sequence modeling architectures. Through pre-training on large-scale unaligned documents using contrastive learning, the One-Encoder demonstrates excellent adaptability and generalization ability, flexibly meeting the needs of various tasks.

### 1.4 Other Related Methods

- **Contrastive Learning**: Contrastive learning is a commonly used method for pre-training single-encoder structures. It learns embeddings of positive and negative sample pairs, enabling the model to effectively train on unaligned documents. This method excels in enhancing model adaptability and generalization, particularly when handling diverse and complex corpora.

- **Large-scale Specialized Pre-training**: Specialized pre-training on specific tasks (such as open-domain question-answering) can significantly enhance a model's performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. By pre-training on open-domain question-answering tasks, DPR greatly improves the accuracy of models in addressing domain-specific issues.

### Summary of Methods

Retrieval methods in RAG systems mainly fall into sparse retrieval and dense retrieval categories. Sparse retrieval methods, such as TF-IDF and BM25, rely on term frequency and inverted indexing and are suitable for general text retrieval tasks. However, their performance is limited by the quality of the database and the query. In contrast, dense retrieval methods, such as DPR, Contriever, and Spider, embed queries and documents into vector spaces and retrieve them based on semantic similarity, demonstrating greater flexibility and adaptability. Additionally, through retriever designs such as Bi-Encoder and One-Encoder, combined with contrastive learning and large-scale specialized pre-training, the model's performance in various tasks is further enhanced.

## 2. Pre-retrieval and Post-retrieval Augmentation

To further improve retrieval quality and optimize the input and output of the generator, pre-retrieval and post-retrieval augmentation strategies have been widely applied in RAG systems. These augmentation strategies not only improve the quality of retrieval results but also significantly enhance the generator's output.

### 2.1 Pre-retrieval Augmentation Methods

**Query2doc**:
- Wang et al. proposed a query expansion method that generates pseudo-documents using a few prompts from a large language model (LLM) to expand relevant information in the original query. This method effectively improves the query's disambiguation ability and provides a clearer retrieval target for the retriever. Experiments on temporary information retrieval datasets have shown that Query2doc significantly enhances the performance of both sparse and dense retrievers.

**Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)**:
- Gao et al. introduced the HyDE method, which guides LLMs to generate hypothetical documents and uses these documents as new query embeddings to search for relevant neighbors, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of retrieval. The HyDE method performs exceptionally well when handling complex queries, especially in cases where context is lacking, significantly enhancing retrieval effectiveness.

**Query Rewrite**:
- Ma et al. proposed the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read framework, where LLMs are prompted to generate retrieval queries and rewrite the original question to better match the retrieval needs. This method not only enhances the retriever's understanding of the input but also significantly improves the

 relevance and consistency of the generated output.

**Query Augmentation**:
- Yu et al. proposed the Query Augmentation method, which combines the original query with the initial generated output to form a new query for further retrieval of relevant information. This method excels at clarifying the relationship between the query and the generated content, helping to extract more relevant information from the corpus and improving the completeness and accuracy of the generated content.

### 2.2 Post-retrieval Augmentation Methods

**Pluggable Reward-driven Context Adapter (PRCA)**:
- Yang et al. proposed a post-retrieval augmentation method based on reinforcement learning. It adjusts retrieved documents and fine-tunes lightweight adapters to better align them with the generator, thereby improving the quality and consistency of the generated content. The PRCA method effectively reduces irrelevant information during the generation process and enhances the fluency of the output.

**Retrieve-Rerank-Generate (R2G)**:
- Glass et al. introduced the R2G method, which re-ranks documents obtained from different retrieval methods to improve the robustness of retrieval results and optimize the final generated answers. This method performs exceptionally well in multimodal retrieval tasks, significantly enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the generated results.

**BlendFilter**:
- Wang et al. proposed the BlendFilter method, which combines pre-retrieval query generation blending with post-retrieval knowledge filtering to better handle complex questions and noisy retrieved knowledge, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the generated content. BlendFilter is particularly effective when dealing with long-tail queries, significantly reducing errors in the generation process.

**Retrieve, Compress, Prepend (RECOMP)**:
- Xu et al. proposed the RECOMP method, which compresses the retrieved documents before context enhancement in the generation process, reducing redundant information and improving the relevance and conciseness of the generated content.

**Lightweight Version of the FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder) Model**:
- HofstÃ¤tter et al. introduced a lightweight version of the FiD model, which compresses the encoding vectors of each retrieved paragraph before concatenation and decoder processing and re-ranks the retrieval results to optimize the generatorâ€™s performance. This method effectively reduces computational costs and improves the efficiency of the generation process.

### Summary of Methods

Pre-retrieval and post-retrieval augmentation methods play a crucial role in improving the overall performance of RAG systems. Pre-retrieval augmentation methods, such as Query2doc, HyDE, Query Rewrite, and Query Augmentation, improve retriever performance in handling complex queries by enhancing query expression. Post-retrieval augmentation methods, such as PRCA, R2G, BlendFilter, RECOMP, and the lightweight version of FiD, further enhance the quality of the generator's output by optimizing the ranking and processing of retrieval results. These methods complement each other, jointly contributing to the improvement of RAG system generation effects.

## 3. Generation and Generation Augmentation

Generators play a crucial role in RAG systems. By optimizing the design and augmentation of generators, the accuracy and relevance of generated text can be significantly improved.

### 3.1 Types of Generators

Generators can be broadly categorized into parameter-accessible (white-box) and parameter-inaccessible (black-box) types.

**Parameter-Accessible Generators (White-Box)**:

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: This architecture independently processes the input and the target and uses cross-attention components to link the input with the target tokens. Representative models include T5 and BART. BART is typically used as a generator in RAG systems, while FiD uses T5 as a generator to achieve higher generation quality.

- **Decoder-Only Architecture**: The decoder-only architecture connects the input and the target, allowing both representations to be constructed in parallel, enabling the model to flexibly adjust generation strategies during the generation process. This architecture achieves the generation process through a single decoder, offering high generation flexibility.

**Parameter-Inaccessible Generators (Black-Box)**:

- Representative models include the GPT series, Codex, and Claude. These generators only allow query input and response reception without access to their internal structures or parameters. Despite this, black-box generators still perform excellently in diverse tasks due to their extensive pre-training and strong generative capabilities.

- **Prompt Retriever**: Rubin et al. proposed a method for training a prompt retriever that uses data generated by language models to provide better examples for the generator for in-context learning, further enhancing generation quality.

- **Document Compression**: Xu et al. proposed a method that compresses retrieved documents before context integration to reduce computational costs and alleviate the burden on the generator when handling large-scale contexts.

### 3.2 Generator Augmentation Methods

The performance of the generator directly affects the final output quality of the RAG system. Through prompt engineering, decoding optimization, and generator fine-tuning, the performance of the generator can be further enhanced.

**Prompt Engineering**:

- **LLMLingua**: This method compresses query length through a small model, speeding up model inference, reducing the negative impact of irrelevant information on the model, and mitigating the "mid-generation loss" phenomenon.

- **ReMoDiffuse**: ChatGPT is used to break down complex descriptions into clear textual scripts, enhancing the accuracy and consistency of generated text.

- **ASAP**: Example tuples (including input code, function definitions, analysis results, and corresponding comments) are integrated into prompts to improve generation quality.

**Decoding Optimization**:

- **InferFix**: This method balances the diversity and quality of generated content by adjusting the decoder's temperature, ensuring that the generated content is both accurate and diverse.

- **SYNCHROMESH**: By restricting the decoder's output vocabulary, this method eliminates potential implementation errors, enhancing the generator's reliability and stability.

**Generator Fine-Tuning**:

- **RETRO**: The retriever's parameters are fixed, and a block cross-attention mechanism is used to combine queries and retrieved content to improve generation effects.

- **APICoder**: This method improves the accuracy and consistency of code generation tasks by fine-tuning the generator with a mix of API information and code blocks.

- **CARE**: By fine-tuning the decoder, this method reduces subtitle and concept detection losses while keeping the encoder and retriever parameters fixed, optimizing the performance of multimodal generation tasks.

### 3.3 Integrated Enhancement of Retrieval and Generation

The integration of retrieval and generation is a key component of RAG systems. By enhancing design at the input, output, and intermediate layers, the overall performance of the model can be significantly improved.

**Input Layer Integration**:

- Input layer integration methods combine retrieved documents with the original input or query and pass them to the generator. This method is widely used in models such as In-Context RALM, FiD, Atlas, and REPLUG, where concatenating input and retrieved documents enables the generator to better handle complex tasks.

**Output Layer Integration**:

- Output layer integration methods improve the quality of generated content by combining retrieval and generation results. In kNN-LM, two distributions of the next token are interpolated during prediction, one guided by the language model and the other by the nearest neighbors in the retrieval corpus, allowing for a more flexible generation process.

**Intermediate Layer Integration**:

- Intermediate layer integration methods introduce semi-parametric modules that incorporate retrieved information into the internal layers of the generation model, interacting with the intermediate representations during generation. Although this integration method increases the model's complexity, effective training can significantly enhance the generative model's capabilities. For example, RETRO processes retrieval blocks within the generator's blocks through a block cross-attention layer, while EAE and TOME integrate retrieved entities and mentions through entity memory and memory attention layers.

### Summary of Methods

The design and augmentation of generators are crucial in RAG systems. By selecting appropriate generator types, optimizing prompt engineering, tuning the decoding process, and fine-tuning generators, the performance of generators can be effectively improved. Furthermore, through integrated enhancement design at the input, output, and intermediate layers, the synergy between retrieval and generation is further optimized, improving the overall generation quality of the RAG system.

## 4. Optimization of Retrieval and Generation Processes

The retrieval and generation processes in RAG systems can be further optimized through design improvements to enhance model efficiency and accuracy. The following sections introduce methods for optimizing retrieval necessity and frequency, training-free and independent training, as well as sequential training and joint training.

### 4.1 Necessity and Frequency of Retrieval

In LLM-based generation processes, retrieval operations are often used to supplement knowledge, enhancing the accuracy of the generated content. However, retrieval is not always necessary, and excessive retrieval may introduce irrelevant information, leading to generation errors. Therefore, determining the necessity and frequency of retrieval is crucial for achieving a robust RAG model.

**Self-RAG**:
- Self-RAG introduces special markers to assess the necessity of retrieval and controls retrieval behavior as needed, thereby reducing unnecessary resource consumption. This method dynamically adjusts retrieval frequency during the generation process, effectively optimizing model efficiency.

**SKR (Self-Knowledge Guided Retrieval)**:
- SKR leverages LLMs' self-assessment abilities to decide whether to invoke the retriever, dynamically adjusting retrieval behavior to reduce unnecessary queries and computations.

**FLARE**:
- FLARE actively decides whether and when to search during the generation process based on probabilities, avoiding excessive retrieval and optimizing the use of computational resources.

**Design of Retrieval Frequency**:
- In the generation process, retrieval frequency determines the degree of reliance on retrieval results, impacting model efficiency and effectiveness. Common settings include one-time retrieval, retrieval every n tokens, and retrieval for each token. Different retrieval frequency strategies balance performance and computational cost, applicable to models like REALM, In-Context RALM, and RETRO.

### 4.2 Training-Free and Independent Training

**Training-Free Methods**:
- With the development of LLMs, many studies suggest enhancing LLMs through retrieval mechanisms without

 fine-tuning model parameters. Methods based on prompt engineering directly integrate retrieved knowledge into the original prompt, improving generation quality. For example, In-Context RAG enhances generation effects by combining retrieved documents with the original prompt.

**Independent Training Methods**:
- In independent training, the retriever and generator are trained as two completely independent modules, without interaction during the training process. DPR uses BERT for contrastive learning training, while CoG improves the accuracy of text generation through the training of prefix and phrase encoders.

### 4.3 Sequential Training and Joint Training

**Sequential Training**:
- Sequential training methods pre-train the retriever or generator independently, then fix the pre-trained module before training the other module. RETRO adopts a BERT model as a pre-trained retriever and integrates retrieval blocks into the model's predictions using an encoder-decoder structure.

**Joint Training**:
- Joint training methods adopt an end-to-end training paradigm, simultaneously optimizing the retriever and generator. RAG jointly trains the retriever and generator by minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss, enhancing the overall system performance. REALM uses a similar training paradigm and employs maximum inner product search techniques to locate the most relevant documents.

### Summary of Methods

By controlling the necessity and frequency of retrieval, selecting training-free and independent training strategies, and optimizing sequential training and joint training processes, the overall performance of RAG systems can be significantly improved. These process optimization methods not only enhance model generation effects but also achieve a good balance in computational efficiency and resource utilization.
