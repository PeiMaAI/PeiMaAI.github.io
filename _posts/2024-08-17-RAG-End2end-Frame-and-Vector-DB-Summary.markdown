# Introduction

With the development of large-scale language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has shown significant advantages in solving complex natural language processing tasks. By combining the capabilities of text generation and information retrieval, RAG greatly enhances model performance, enabling it to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers in knowledge-intensive tasks. This technology has been widely applied not only in question-answering systems but also in enterprise applications, document management, customer support, and other fields, offering innovative solutions.

However, with the rapid advancement of RAG, numerous frameworks and tools have emerged in the market. Each of these tools has its unique features—some focus on privacy protection, others on optimizing performance and flexibility, while some offer powerful extensibility and integration options. This article provides a comprehensive summary of the current mainstream RAG frameworks and related vector databases, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses to help readers make more informed decisions when selecting and deploying RAG solutions.
